# Test suite for for baremetal rgw-multisite deployment and testing multisite sync at scale.
#
# This suite deploys a Longevity environment on baremetal machines. It is a multisite environment with each site having a storage capacity of 617Tb.
# each site has around 4 osd hosts and a total of 16 osds.
# A single realm (India) spanning across two RHCS clusters. It has a
# zonegroup (shared) which also spans across the clusters. There exists a master (primary)
# and secondary (secondary) zone within this group. The master zone is part of the pri
# cluster whereas the sec zone is part of the sec datacenter (cluster).

# The deployment is evaluated by running IOs across the environments.
# tested with conf file: conf/baremetal/extensa_mero_multisite_1admin_5node_along_client.yaml
