"""Module to verify resize operations while changing the image feature.

Test case covered -
CEPH-9861 - Perform resize operations while changing the image feature.

Pre-requisites :
1. Cluster must be up and running with capacity to create pool
2. We need atleast one client node with ceph-common package,
   conf and keyring files

Test Case Flow:
1. Create a pool
2. Create an image
3. Run Ios on Image
4. While disabling the image feature, perform image resize (increase size) operation
    Image size should be increased with disable image feature
5. While enabling the image feature, perform image resize (decrease size) operation
    Image size should be shrinked with enable image feature
6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 for ecpool
