    Returns:
        int: The return value. 0 for success, 1 otherwise

    Pre-requisites :
    We need atleast one client node with ceph-common package,
    conf and keyring files

    Test cases covered -
    1) CEPH-11409 Delayed Deletion - Create a clone of a RBD image,
    and then try to delete the parent image while the relationship is active.
    Create snaps on it, and clones from it.
    Test Case Flow
    1. Create a Rep pool and an Image
    2. Create multi level snaps on it, and clones from it.
    3. Move parent images to trash
    4. Flatten the clone when parent image is in trash
    5. Unprotect and delete the snap while the image is in trash.(use --image-id)
    6. Restore the image from the trash. Start IOs on the image using rbd bench.
    7. While IOs is going on delete the image.
    8. Stop IOs and then move the image to trash and delete the image permanently.
