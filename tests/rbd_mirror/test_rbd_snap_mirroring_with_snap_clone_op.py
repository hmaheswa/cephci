    Test Case Flow
    1. Bootstrap two CEPH clusters and setup snapshot based mirroring in between these clusters
    2. Create pools and images as specified, enable snapshot based mirroring for all these images
    3. Schedule snapshots for each of these images and run IOs on each of the images
    4. Perform the operations like add snapshots - remove snapshots - list snapshots - rollback
        snapshots - purge snapshots
    5. Try snapshot creation/deletion from secondary cluster
    6. Perform Clone Operations like protect snapshot,  clone the snapshot,  unprotect snapshot,
        flatten clone
    7. Try above operation from secondary
    8. Perform snap schedule operations like, add/list/status/remove from both primary and secondary
        clusters
